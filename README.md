1. Title: User Identification From Walking Activity

	
2. Abstract: The dataset collects data from an Android smartphone positioned in the chest pocket. Accelerometer Data are collected from 6 participants walking in the wild over a predefined path. The dataset is intended for Activity Recognition research purposes. It provides challenges for identification and authentication of people using motion patterns.

3. Relevant Information:
   --- The dataset collects data from an Android smartphone accelerometer positioned in the chest pocket
   --- Sampling frequency of the accelerometer: DELAY_FASTEST with network connections disabled
   --- Number of Participants: 6
   --- Data Format: CSV

4. Dataset Information
   --- Data are separated by participant
   --- Each file contains the following information
       ---- time-step, x acceleration, y acceleration, z acceleration
